# Inspiration
Inspired by Vinli a platform that turns older cars into smart cars plugging IoT devices in to their ODBII port, bringing them in to the realm of smart devices. MotODBII seeks to accomplish this for motorcycles as well, allowing Motocycles to receive the same data for preventative diagnostics and giving drivers a blockchain.

# What it does
Simulation and blockchain platform that shows that impact that IoT could have on Motorcycles.

# How I built it
Part I: Arduino + RaspberryPi hardware simulation of a Motorcycle or moped. Part II:

# Challenges I ran into
Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Collaborating in team of people with different backgrounds and skill levels.

# What I learned
What's next for MotOBDII
Possibly prototyping a device to get data from a Motocycles computer

# Built With
ark
